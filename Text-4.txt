Unit testing - 

Test Requirement: Test shuffle deck.
Test Path: print, shuffle, print deck.

Test Requirement: Test clearHand(), getHandTotal().
Test Path: deal cards then print, get total, clear hand and print again.

Test Requirement: Test dealOne().
Test Path: dealOne(),print card, dealOne(), print card.

Test Requirement: Test the probability of getting a 5 Card Charlie
Test Path: A deck with 16 sets is created. A player will be dealt 5 cards at a time until deck is empty. 
After each set of five cards, hand is printed cleared and checked to see if player busted. 
A counter is kept for every time 5 Card Charlie is reached. When the deck is empty, 166 hands later, 
the counter variable is used to determine the probability.

Test Requirement: Test the probability of getting a blackjack on first two cards.
Test Path: A deck with 16 sets is created. A player is dealt 2 cards at a time until deck is empty (416 hands). 
After each set of two cards is dealt hand is cleared, printed and getHandValue() is checked. A counter is kept to 
keep track of amount of blackjacks. When the deck has been emptied the counter is used to determine the 
probability. 

System testing â€“ The overall design of the system still does as expected. With the addition of the Dealer 
class the player is no longer able to use the deck leaving ownership to the dealer.
